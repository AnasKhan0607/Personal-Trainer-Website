            <p>Where should I start. Anas Khan has been with me since the very begining. He has turned my whole life around and i will always be greatful. I started off as a relitvely skiny kid which resluted in lower self confidence. I always dreamt of having a body like my role model Arnold but didnt know where to start. This is when I came across Anas at a local gym. He was watching me do an exercise and came over to show me how to correctly perform it. I started asking him other questions and he loved sharing his knowledge. I found out he is a personal trainer and made the decision that i wanted someone as enthusiastic as him mentoring me. So i got his number and that is when my journey started. I wanted to put on as much lean muscle as i could without gaining too much fat. He worked with me to create the perfect meal plan and workout routine inorder for me to do so. He checked up on me through out the whole process and awnswered any questions I had. In just a month I had put on 10 pounds of lean muscle and was feeling better than ever. He is by far the best fitness trainer I have met and really loves what he does. I would recommend him for anyone who wants to turn their life around no matter what their fitness goals are. Thanks Anas I really appreciate everything you have done for me!

            <p>I have had the pleasure to work with Anas Khan for over a year. Not only has he been an amazing trainer, but has been a great friend through out the process.I first started working with Anas a week after my birthday last year. I was looking at my birthday pitures and realized how much I had let myself go. I came to the conclution it was time to change and decided to contact Anas through a mutual friend. I really needed help creating a meal plan since I was eating whatever I looked at. It was almost summer and I wanted to work towards my dream body which meant I had to change up my eating habits. Through the whole process Anas helped me stay on track and did weekly check ups to see how i was progressing. The meal plans he made were extreamly tasty and very easy to follow. In just a month I started seeing huge changes and cut down 10 pounds. Ever since I have been working with Anas to further better myself and achieve new goals. Anas has always been there for me and is the best coach anyone can have. Thank you Anas it has been a pleasure working with you. I would recommond Anas to anyone who wants to turn their life around and achieve their fitness goals.</p>

            <p>Where should I start. Anas Khan has been with me since the very begining. Not only has he been a wonderful coach, but I truly consider her a mentor. I started off as a skinny fat kid and didnt know if i should start with a bulk or cut. I searched around the internet for a long time for a trainer to guide me. This is when I came across Anas on his website. I started asking him a bunch of questions through his contact page and he loved sharing his knowledge. I finally made the decision that i wanted someone as enthusiastic as him mentoring me. So i got his number and that is when my journey started. I wanted to put on as much lean muscle as i could without gaining too much fat. He worked with me to create the perfect meal plan and workout routine inorder for me to do so. He checked up on me through out the whole process and awnswered any questions I had. In just a month I had put on 10 pounds of lean muscle and was feeling better than ever. He is by far the best fitness trainer I have met and really loves what he does. I would recommend him for anyone who wants to turn their life around no matter what their fitness goals are. Thanks Anas I really appreciate everything you have done for me! You will be lucky to have a coach as devoted as Anas.
